 Vercel Clone

## Overview
The **Vercel Clone** project is a platform designed to replicate the functionalities of Vercel, enabling users to deploy front-end applications with seamless integrations and a smooth user experience. This application leverages modern technologies to provide an efficient deployment process and an intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (ECS, ECR, S3)
- **Deployment**: Reverse Proxy

## Features
- **Isolated Environments**: Utilized **Docker** to create isolated environments for serving React dist files (static assets), facilitating efficient and scalable deployment.
- **AWS Integration**: 
  - Uploaded Docker images to **AWS ECR** for secure storage.
  - Managed deployment clusters using **AWS ECS** for seamless scaling.
  - Hosted static files on **AWS S3** for reliable content delivery.
- **Reverse Proxy Setup**: Designed a reverse proxy to stream `index.html`, ensuring quick and smooth access to the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Developed a user-friendly and responsive front-end using **React.js** to enhance user interaction and accessibility.
